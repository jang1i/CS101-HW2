# Problem 1
def evaluate(x, y, z):
    # Fill in the body of this function and modify the return statement below as needed.
    result = 5 + ((y * z + x) / (3 / (4 * x + 1))) - 3
    return result

# i thought i was supposed to do 'return evaluate' not 'return result' but even then i thought i was also supposed to do 'return evaluate (x, y, z)'

# Problem 2
def vacation_cost(adults, children, days):
    # Fill in the body of this function and modify the return statement below as needed.
    cost = adults * 100 * days + children * 75 * (days - 2) + (15 * (adults + children)) 
    return cost

# same here, typing 'return vacation_cost' is not working

# Problem 3
def part_info(h, w, d, n):
    # Fill in the body of this function and modify the return statement below as needed.
    area = (d * n * 4) + (d * n * 8) + (((h + n) * (w + n)) - 4 * w **2) 
    volume = (w * d * h) - 4 * (n * n * d)
    return area, volume
# this one just didnt work at all 


# Problem 4
def euro_to_usd(exchange_rate, cent1, cent2, cent5, cent10, cent20):
    # Fill in the body of this function and modify the return statement below as needed.
    return 0

# i dont even know where to start with this one
